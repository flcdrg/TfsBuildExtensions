            <para/>The input assemblies are processed in the order they are specified. This option is mutually exclusive with specifying an attribute assembly, i.e., the property AttributeFile.

            This property is used only in conjunction with the Internalize property (Section 2.12). When this is set before calling Merge, it indicates 
            <para/>the path and filename that will be used to identify types that are not to have their visibility modified.
            <para/>If Internalize is true, but ExcludeFile is "", then all types in any assembly other than the primary assembly are made non-public.
            <para/>Setting this property implicitly sets Internalize to true. The contents of the file should be one regular expression per line.
            <para/>The syntax is that defined in the .NET namespace System.Text.RegularExpressions for regular expressions.
            <para/>The regular expressions are matched against each type's full name, e.g., "System.Collections.IList".
            <para/>If the match fails, it is tried again with the assembly name (surrounded by square brackets) prepended to the type name.
            <para/>Thus, the pattern “\[A\].*” excludes all types in assembly A from being made non-public. (The backslashes are required because the string is treated as a regular expression.)
            <para/>The pattern “N.T” will match all types named T in the namespace named N no matter what assembly they are defined in.
            <para/> It is important to note that the regular expressions are not anchored to the beginning of the string; if this is desired, use the appropriate regular expression operator characters to do so.

        <member name="P:TfsBuildExtensions.Activities.Framework.ILMerge.StrongNameLost">
            <summary>
            Once merging is complete, this property is true if and only if the primary assembly had a strong name, but the target assembly does not. 
            <para/>This can occur when an .snk file is not specified, or if something goes wrong trying to read its contents.

        <member name="P:TfsBuildExtensions.Activities.Framework.ILMerge.TargetKind">
            <summary>
            This controls whether the target assembly is created as a library, a console application or as a Windows application. When it is not specified, then the target 
            <para/>assembly will be the same kind as that of the primary assembly. (In that case, the file extensions found on the specified target assembly and the primary 
            <para/>assembly must match.) When it is specified, then the file extension of the target assembly must match the specification. The possible values are TargetKind.{Dll, Exe, SameAsPrimaryAssembly}
            <para/>Command line option: /target:(library|exe|winexe)
            <para/>Default: SameAsPrimaryAssembly

        <member name="P:TfsBuildExtensions.Activities.Framework.ILMerge.UnionMerge">
            <summary>
            When this is true, then types with the same name are all merged into a single type in the target assembly. The single type is the union of all of the individual 
            <para/>types in the input assemblies: it contains all of the members from each of the corresponding types in the input assemblies. It cannot be specified at the same time as /allowDup.
            <para/>Command line option: /union
            <para/>Default: false

        <member name="P:TfsBuildExtensions.Activities.Framework.ILMerge.Version">
            <summary>
            When this has a non-null value, then the target assembly will be given its value as the version number of the assembly. When specified on the command line, the 
            <para/>version is read in as a string and should look like "6.2.1.3" (but without the quote marks). The version must be a valid assembly version as defined by the attribute AssemblyVersion in the System.Reflection namespace.
            <para/>Command line option: /ver:version
            <para/>Default: null

            <summary>
            This property controls whether XML documentation files are merged to produce an XML documentation file for the target assembly.
            <para/>Command line option: /xmldocs
            <para/>Default: false
