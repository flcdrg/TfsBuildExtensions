TfsBuildExtensions
==================

Fork of tfsbuildextensions.codeplex.com with DotCover support.

It is intended that any stable features added here will be offered back to the CodePlex project. Because the original 
project uses TFS source-control bindings, doing a fork in CodePlex isn't possible.
